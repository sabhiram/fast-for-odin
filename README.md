A simple board game timer

## How does it work?

Make a new room with `N` players. Specify the starting allowance of time per player, as well as the increase in time per round.  Once a room has been created, a unique ID will be assigned to it.  All other players can access this room using this link.

Once enough users join, the host puts them in player order and kicks off the round.  Each player gets their turn, and their personal timer will decrement.
