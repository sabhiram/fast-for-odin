A simple board game timer

## How does it work?

1. Visit `/` and from there you can either join a room or make a new one.
2. Rooms are assigned a unique ID and are open for ppl to join
3. Once N ppl join, everyone is asked to ready up after the host assigns the play order (drag and drop?)
4. Each person says "im done" and the turn is passed to the next person...
5. Server stores this as a single JSON for now, once the room is done, and everyone leaves things clean up (24hrs)
6. Use a cookie like doordash to do the name for all guests and host
